Leverage the same integration code as OpenAI's official libraries by simply adjusting the API key and base URL in your requests. For self-hosted setups, ensure to switch the base URL to your local server's address as mentioned above.

### Example Usage with OpenAI Libraries

#### Python Example

```python
import openai

openai.api_key = 'anything'
openai.base_url = "http://localhost:3040/v1/"

completion = openai.chat.completions.create(

    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "How do I list all files in a directory using Python?"},
    ],
)
